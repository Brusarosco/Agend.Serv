The "AgendamentoServico" system is a simple backend application that offers scheduling functionalities for various services, such as medical appointments and restaurant reservations. Developed in Java with Spring Boot, the system uses an architecture based on REST API, providing CRUD operations for clients, services and schedules. Entities are persisted in a database through Hibernate. This implementation is intended for learning purposes and demonstrates the basic structure of a scheduling system.
